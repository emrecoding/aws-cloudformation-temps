# Project Overview

This project aims to provide a complete solution for deploying a scalable and highly available WordPress site using AWS CloudFormation templates. Through the utilization of various AWS services, the project ensures a seamless deployment and management experience.

## Components

### **1. Network Components**

A CloudFormation template is used to set up all the necessary networking components. This includes VPC, subnets, route tables, and more, ensuring a secure and isolated environment for the other resources.

### **2. Database (RDS) Components**

The database components are configured using a CloudFormation template that sets up an RDS instance. This ensures that the data for the WordPress site is stored in a robust and scalable manner.

### **3. Compute (EC2) Components**

Compute resources, including the installation of WordPress on EC2 instances, are handled through a CloudFormation template. This ensures that the application runs smoothly and can handle varying levels of traffic.

### **4. ELB, ACM Components**

The CloudFormation template for setting up Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) components also includes configuration for target groups. This helps in distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.

### **5. DNS (Route 53) Components**

DNS components, including domain registration and DNS routing, are managed through a CloudFormation template utilizing Route 53. This allows for efficient routing of web traffic to the deployed resources.

### **6. SNS and SQS Notifications**

Integration with Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS) is accomplished through a dedicated CloudFormation template. This enables notifications and messaging, ensuring that the system can react to different events and conditions.

## Conclusion

This project encapsulates a complete WordPress deployment solution on AWS, utilizing CloudFormation for automation and scalability. With focus on robustness, security, and ease of use, it leverages key AWS services like EC2, RDS, ELB, ACM, Route 53, SNS, and SQS. Whether you're deploying a simple blog or a high-traffic business website, these templates provide you with0 the basic foundation you need to get kickstarted on your project/application.
